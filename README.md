Vite + React Student Registration (Two-step)

Getting started:

1. Open a terminal in `C:\fdfw\End_Sem\End_sem`.
2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to view the app.

Files added:
- `index.html` — Vite entry
- `package.json`, `vite.config.js` — project config
- `src/` — React entry and components (`App.jsx`, `components/StudentForm.jsx`, `index.css`)

If you want, I can run `npm install` and `npm run dev` for you now.
